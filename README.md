# sumCalculation
Here is an example of a simple CPU-bound program written in x86 Assembly. This program demonstrates how to perform basic computations, focusing entirely on keeping the CPU busy with calculations.

The example calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to a given limit (n), which is a common workload for a CPU-bound task.

This program demonstrates a simple CPU task. You can modify the limit value to test different workloads.

For instance, if n = 100  then Sum = 5050.
