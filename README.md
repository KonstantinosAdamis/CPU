# CPU
Assembly

Here is an example of a simple CPU-bound program written in x86 Assembly. This program demonstrates how to perform basic computations, focusing entirely on keeping the CPU busy with calculations.

The example calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to a given limit (n), which is a common workload for a CPU-bound task.
